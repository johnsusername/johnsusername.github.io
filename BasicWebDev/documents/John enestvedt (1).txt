        <h3> The history of festable</h3>
            Festable is a place in Cadott, WI, where musicians play their music and people go to have fun. There is meny different types of musicians who play at Festable, rock, country and EDM. it is a good place to go to have fun. Recently they changed the name of country fest to Hoof Beats. Changing the name to Hoof Beats was not only pointless but it will also be a bad impact on Country Fest itself.

        <h3> Why change the name now!!! </h3>     
        country fest was a great name and well-known threw out chippwa county. <q>"hoof beat was called country fest for 37 years according to 15news".</q> if it was called country fest for 37 years why change it now. besides even if they were forced to change it, why hoof beats? i know they could have made something better.
            <hr/>
          <h3>  A name may not be the most importiant thing but its not pointless </h3> according to volume, <q>"1 they changed the name to better reflect their roots". </q> But hat is unnessissary country fest's music choices should do that instead of the name. All in all, country fest isnt going to be ruined by the name but it wasent a very good choice. thats why they should change thier name back to country fest.
